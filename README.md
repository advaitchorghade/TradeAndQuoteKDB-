# TradeAndQuoteKDB-
Analyse trade data using KDB+/Q. 

This repo looks to introduce some useful code to extract and analyst TAQ (trade and quote) data for certain stocks. We will later explore potential trading oppertunities using simple pairs trading, including imlpementation of fees and crossing the spread costs. 

Some TAQ files are excess of 10GB. Therefore, to preserve Github's storage constraints, we will upload data from 09:00 - 09:40 Eastern time (ET) for lesser liquid names. In this case, AXP (American Express) and MA (Mastercard). There timeframe should enable us to explore both premarket and market abitrage oppertunities.
